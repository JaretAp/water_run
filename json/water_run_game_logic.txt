Water Run – Game Logic


1. Game Start

When the game loads, the Start Screen appears with the title “Water Run,” a subtitle (“Inspired by charity: water”), and a large Start Game! button.

No gameplay elements are active yet.

Once the user taps “Start Game!,” the game transitions to the Gameplay Screen, initializing score = 0, timer = full duration (e.g., 2 minutes), and player lives/jug slots.

2. Player Actions

Player can tap/hold left/right/up/down (or swipe) to move their runner character across the screen.

The runner moves forward automatically but must be directed around obstacles and hazards.

The player collects yellow jugs by colliding with them.

If the player collides with a black shape (block), movement is blocked.

If the player collides with a hazard (red/danger arrows or stars), they drop a jug they’re carrying or lose points/time.

3. Game Logic

The system continuously checks:

Timer countdown (game ends when time hits zero).

Collisions between the runner and:

Yellow jug → increment jug count.

Block (black rectangle/circle/triangle) → stop movement.

Hazard (arrows/stars) → penalty (lose jug, lose life, or subtract score).

Game updates player position, score, and timer every frame.

4. Score/Feedback

Score increases by +1 each time a jug is collected.

Score decreases or jug count drops if the player hits a hazard.

Timer bar and numbers decrease visually in real time.

Feedback includes:

Jug icon flashing when collected.

Danger icon flashing when hit.

Score counter and jug count updating in the HUD.

5. Win or Lose Conditions

Lose condition: Timer reaches 0, or player loses all jugs (depending on your final rule).

Win condition: Player reaches the end of the run with at least the minimum jug target collected.

On either outcome, the Game Over Screen appears with:

“GAME OVER” (red/alert or branded yellow).

A motivational message: “Each jug helps bring clean water to families in need.”

6. Reset/Replay

On the Game Over Screen, a Play Again button is displayed.

When tapped, the game resets:

Timer is restored to full.

Score/jug count resets to 0.

Player is repositioned at the start of the level.
